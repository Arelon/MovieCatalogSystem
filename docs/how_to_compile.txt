1. Before you try to compile the project in you IDE you need to run the
Ant "generate-metamodel" task which will add additional source root
"source/java-generated-metamodel" directory in the project root with static
JPA metamodel.

2. Do not commit files in source/java-generated-metamodel directory to source control.

3. Include SQL and GUI files to the "resources filter" (that is, these files must be
included beside compiled Java files for app to be able to run properly).

4. if you have problems running ant/ivy take a look at screenshots besides this manual

5. (for running) startup directory must be set as ${project.dir}/startup
