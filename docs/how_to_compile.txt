1. Before you try to compile the project in you IDE you need to run the
Ant "generate-metamodel" task which will add additional source root
"src-generated-metamodel" directory in the project root with static
JPA metamodel.

2. Do not commit files in src-generated-metamodel directory to source control.

3. Include SQL files in the "resources filter" (that is, SQL files must be included beside
compiled Java files).

4. if you have problems running ant/ivy take a look at screenshots besides this manual

5. (for running) startup directory must be set as ${project.dir}/startup
